# Pyro5

https://pyro5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Pyro is not restricted to messages, but sharing "resources" across machines. Kombu seems to be able to use Pyro as backend (as replacement for a message broker)

```
pip install Pyro5
```

## Pyro4?
There is also Pyro4, but the development is frozen in favor for Pyro5.
